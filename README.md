===============

A small, totally custom, soft-core cpu  that I developed for the VHDL class @ teipir in 2009

This includes an assembler and emulator (writen in C#), The original vhdl code (writen for 
some old FLEX 10K fpga board) and my presentation for the lab (in both eng and gr !)

I've also implemented a small brix clone as a demonstration/test (it's loaded by default 
on the assembler)

This was my first vhdl project!
